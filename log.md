# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: July 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More of a recording of the past few days' work. Finished the 'night mode' mockup of the site. 'Day mode' is structurally complete, but color scheme is still subject to change.

**Thoughts:** Getting back into the swing of things with Figma was overall not difficult. Started slow, but thanks to past experience, I got used to it quicker.
I want to stop with the mockup so I can start site development. I need to speak with Aaron to find out how he got started on his site

**Link to work:** Will upload the mockups once I get the project directory established.

### Day 5: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spoke to Aaron about how to tackle this project. After some thinking, I've come to a decision (see 'Thoughts' below)

**Thoughts:** I might have to break one of the rules of the 100 Days of Code by using some of the days to learn the languages necessary. The more I learn about the languages, the better my experience in this project will be. I will start by finishing the SoloLearn course on JS, followed by ReactJS (method TBA). Then I'll move to Node. 
At the end of the day, if I end up learning more about the languages and can apply them to the creation of GNA, it will all be worth it.  

**Link to work:** Still have yet to establish a project directory, But Ive decided to create a folder in the 100-days-of-code directory to show images how far I've come in learning. 

### Day 8: July 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: After work, I finally did a full hour of code!! I learned a bit about JS object and object types. Managed to experiment a bit and the test worked!

Also created a folder logging the progress I make in learning a programming language on SoloLearn. The folder is called 'CompletedLessonImgs'. It contains imgs, but I feel I should use a more concise way to display progress here

**Thoughts:** Maybe I should my ability in HTML/CSS to make a static version of the site? Just to have something made that's quite relevant to the project? I'll probably give in and start working on it this week: I know how my mind works...

**Link to work:** See 'CompletedLessonImgs' folder for today's progress.

### Day 13: July 18, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Made headway into the static version of the website! Learned a bit about the CSS media function. It's sorta like an if statement, which made it pretty simple to understand

**Thoughts:** I've not been the best when it comes to logging down progress. I need to do better, AND stick myself to doing an hour, maybe an hour and a half a day, rather than the 4 hours I spent today.

**Link to work:** See the 'main' folder located in my "Gaming News Aggregator" repository for my progress on the static page. Then, check 'CompletedLessonImgs' folder for today's SoloLearn progress. 

### Day 15: July 20, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Finished the 'Core Objects' and 'Functions' sections of SoloLearn's JS course! Two more to go and I can start on Node.

**Thoughts:** Missed a day, which sucks, but at least I worked today! 

When it comes to what I've been learning so far, its been pretty simple. The Date function is new, and might take a second to grasp, but its not too important a function to know right now. Math might be a bit more handy, and since it's familiar to the python iteration, it shouldn't be so bad.

**Link to work:** Check 'CompletedLessonImgs' folder for today's SoloLearn progress.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: July 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More of a recording of the past few days' work. Finished the 'night mode' mockup of the site. 'Day mode' is structurally complete, but color scheme is still subject to change.

**Thoughts:** Getting back into the swing of things with Figma was overall not difficult. Started slow, but thanks to past experience, I got used to it quicker.
I want to stop with the mockup so I can start site development. I need to speak with Aaron to find out how he got started on his site

**Link to work:** Will upload the mockups once I get the project directory established.

### Day 5: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spoke to Aaron about how to tackle this project. After some thinking, I've come to a decision (see 'Thoughts' below)

**Thoughts:** I might have to break one of the rules of the 100 Days of Code by using some of the days to learn the languages necessary. The more I learn about the languages, the better my experience in this project will be. I will start by finishing the SoloLearn course on JS, followed by ReactJS (method TBA). Then I'll move to Node. 
At the end of the day, if I end up learning more about the languages and can apply them to the creation of GNA, it will all be worth it.  

**Link to work:** Still have yet to establish a project directory, But Ive decided to create a folder in the 100-days-of-code directory to show images how far I've come in learning.
